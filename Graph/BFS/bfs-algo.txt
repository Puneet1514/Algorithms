A way for traversing graphs

Processed with the help of "QUEUE"

FULL FORM - BREADTH FIRST SEARCH

As the name BFS suggests, you are required to traverse the graph breadthwise as follows:
1. First move horizontally and visit all the nodes of the current layer
2. Move to the next layer

psuedo code :


BFS (G, s)   //Where G is the graph and s is the source node let Q be queue.
      Q.enqueue( s ) //Inserting s in queue until all its neighbour vertices are marked.

      mark s as visited.
      while ( Q is not empty)
           //Removing that vertex from queue,whose neighbour will be visited now
           v  =  Q.dequeue( )

          //processing all the neighbours of v  
          for all neighbours w of v in Graph G
               if w is not visited 
                        Q.enqueue( w )             //Stores w in Q to further visit its neighbour
                        mark w as visited.
